/*
 * moq_endpoint_t — the service-tier connection object: URL → managed
 * connection + session. Owns threading, version negotiation (ALPN / WT
 * protocol tokens), TLS/SNI defaults, terminal-state classification, the
 * sticky interrupt latch, pump multiplexing for attached media services, and
 * the post() executor that makes the full moq_session_* surface reachable
 * without exposing the pump.
 *
 * Design: MEDIA_SERVICE_DESIGN.md §5. This tier is severable: lower tiers
 * build and work without it (MOQ_BUILD_SERVICE), the core stays sans-I/O,
 * and all threading lives here.
 *
 * Current status: lifecycle and version negotiation are live over the
 * managed picoquic facades (RAW_QUIC via moq_pq_threaded with ALPN
 * offer-list + readback, WEBTRANSPORT via moq_pico_wt_managed with WT
 * protocol tokens). picoquic is the DEFAULT RAW_QUIC backend. When compiled
 * in and selected explicitly via cfg.backend, RAW_QUIC is ALSO served by
 * mvfst (moq_mvfst_managed, exact-version) and by MsQuic (moq_msquic_managed,
 * exact-version, the shared lane pump API — the path intended for future
 * sharded relay work), and WEBTRANSPORT by proxygen (moq_proxygen_wt_managed,
 * full negotiation); AUTO keeps choosing picoquic/pico_wt (msquic/mvfst are
 * opt-in only, never selected ahead of picoquic). Offers go out in PREFERENCE ORDER (AUTO =
 * every version this build supports, newest first); the negotiated version
 * configures the session before any SETUP byte is parsed, and an un-negotiable
 * connection fails terminally rather than silently downgrading.
 *
 * Media receiver/sender attach APIs are live (see moq/media_receiver.h and
 * moq/media_sender.h). v0 supports at most one receiver attachment and one
 * sender attachment per endpoint; while attached, moq_endpoint_stop() is gated
 * by the endpoint attachment count.

 *   - It does NOT mean all packets were acknowledged by the peer (the QUIC

 *    with session == NULL as the closed marker; fn cleans up ctx only in
 *    that case. No accepted task is silently dropped.
 *  - Accepted tasks run in submission order (FIFO).
 *  - fn MUST NOT block: it runs on the managed execution context; a
 *    blocking fn stalls every attachment on this endpoint (and, on
 *    wtquic-Network, the transport's own serial domain).
 *  - Memory visibility: everything fn writes before returning is visible to
