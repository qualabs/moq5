 * moq_media_sender_t — the send-side media facade over an endpoint
 * (MEDIA_SERVICE_DESIGN.md §7). Owns a publisher on the endpoint's
 * network thread: it advertises a namespace, derives and publishes a
 * retained MSF catalog from the configured tracks, and reports readiness
 * once the namespace is accepted and the catalog is published. The
 * application adds tracks and submits media objects from its own thread.
 *
 * Current status: tracks, catalog, readiness, and the media write path are
 * live -- objects written from the app thread are enqueued in decode order
 * into a bounded, per-track sync-anchored queue and drained to the session
 * on the network thread, generating standard LOC-01 properties from the
 * typed fields and abandoning open subgroups wire-correctly under
 * backpressure. LOC-02 (the draft-18 KVP profile) is a coordinated
 * stack-wide future item; today everything is LOC-01.
