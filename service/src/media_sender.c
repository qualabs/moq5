/*
 * moq_media_sender_t — send-side media facade over an endpoint
 * (MEDIA_SERVICE_DESIGN.md §7). Tracks, catalog, readiness, and the media
 * write path: objects written from the app thread are enqueued in decode
 * order into a bounded, per-track sync-anchored queue and drained to the
 * session on the network thread, generating standard LOC-01 properties
 * from the typed fields, applying the configured backpressure policy, and
 * abandoning open subgroups wire-correctly (reset_group) on a drop.
 *
 * Threading mirrors the receiver: the publisher lives on the endpoint's
 * network thread, driven from the SENDER pump hook (run under the endpoint
 * mutex; no public endpoint API re-entry). The application calls
 * add_track / write from its own thread; the mutex below is the
 * happens-before edge between the two.
