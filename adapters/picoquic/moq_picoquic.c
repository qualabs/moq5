/* -- Per-stream receive backpressure --------------------------------- *
 * Raw picoquic auto-grows each stream's receive window as bytes are consumed
 * (MAX_STREAM_DATA doubles once the app passes half the window), so a stalled
 * application -- the bridge returning MOQ_ERR_WOULD_BLOCK and retaining the
 * input -- does NOT stop the peer: the advertised window keeps advancing and
 * the sender keeps filling the connection. This gives the ADAPTER byte-level
 * receive flow control, so an application stall becomes real QUIC backpressure:
 *
 *   - On first sight of ANY inbound stream the adapter puts it under picoquic
 *     application-controlled flow control (picoquic_set_app_flow_control),
 *     which freezes that stream's window; the adapter then owns every advance.
 *   - The window is kept `budget` bytes ahead of the app's forward progress,
 *     where budget is the local initial_max_stream_data_* this endpoint
 *     advertised for the stream's category and initiator -- so the adapter
 *     never grants MORE than the operator's configured window. A zero budget is
 *     honored as zero (a bare FIN is admitted, payload is not); unreadable
 *     transport parameters fail closed rather than fabricate credit. While a
 *     stream has retained bridge work the window is NOT advanced
 *     (picoquic_open_flow_control is withheld), so the peer stalls once it
 *     exhausts the frozen window: durable backpressure.
 *   - picoquic delivers bytes already inside the advertised window even after
 *     the bridge first blocks -- consumed_offset advances before the data
 *     callback and the callback cannot decline delivery. Those bytes are
 *     retained bounded per stream (the bound is the advertised window; the peer
 *     cannot exceed it without a flow-control violation) and replayed IN ORDER
 *     after service() clears that stream's pending state, re-pausing if the
 *     replay itself blocks. Nothing is dropped, duplicated, or reordered.
 *
 * CONTROL streams get the same per-stream mechanism (independent control: a
 * control stall pauses only the control stream, never a media stream, and vice
 * versa). Routing kind is preserved: a paused control stream replays through
 * on_peer_control_bytes.
 *
 * Credit grants are BATCHED (quantum = budget/2): picoquic_open_flow_control's
 * expected_data_size both re-anchors the stream window (consumed + expected --
 * self-limiting) and blindly increments the connection-wide MAX_DATA by the
 * same amount (frames.c picoquic_format_max_data_frame). Granting on every
 * callback would therefore inflate connection credit unboundedly; granting at
 * most once per budget/2 of application progress bounds the ADAPTER-INDUCED
 * connection MAX_DATA increments to <= 2x the app's forward progress (+ the
 * initial window). That bound covers only this adapter's contribution:
 * picoquic's own automatic MAX_DATA growth (delivery-anchored,
 * 2*offset_received > maxdata_local) remains active and is not bounded by the
 * adapter. Connection-level credit is NOT directly application-controlled:
 * picoquic's only conn-level control (picoquic_set_max_data_control) disables
 * picoquic_open_flow_control outright (mutually exclusive by the
 * max_data_limit guard) -- raw attach callers must NOT enable it (see the
 * public header). TOTAL connection arrest is therefore DERIVATIVE: once every
 * stream's frozen window is exhausted, delivery stops, which stops both the
 * automatic advance (anchored to offset_received) and the adapter's bounded
 * increments.
 *
 * Grants are issued only while the connection is READY:
 * picoquic_open_flow_control silently no-ops in any other state, so a grant
 * attempted earlier is retained as OWED (granted is not advanced) and issued
 * by the post-service sweep once the connection is READY.
