/*
 * moq_pq_send_queue.h -- adapter-owned outbound queue for picoquic pull sending.
 *
 * The picoquic endpoints send MoQ stream data with picoquic's "just in time"
 * (pull) API: the endpoint keeps the bytes in this queue, marks the stream
 * active, and copies them into picoquic's packet buffer from the
 * picoquic_callback_prepare_to_send callback, only when the transport is ready
 * to put them on the wire.
 *
 * The queue owns what it holds:
 *   - copied chunks   (borrowed bridge bytes: control/header/small literals),
 *   - rcbuf chunks    (payload writes; the rcbuf is retained until drained),
 *   - a FIN flag on the final chunk (a zero-length chunk carries a bare FIN).
 * All are released exactly once on drain, drop, or destroy.
 *
 * An aggregate byte cap bounds the buffered backlog: a push over the cap is
 * refused so the bridge retains and retries, except a push onto an empty
 * aggregate always succeeds so a single object larger than the cap is never
 * permanently blocked.
 *
 * Transport-agnostic (no picoquic dependency): the endpoint owns the picoquic
 * glue (mark_active_stream / provide_stream_data_buffer). Single-threaded:
 * confined to the network thread like the rest of the adapter.
