# FindPicoquic.cmake
#
# Provides picoquic::picoquic-core for moq-adapter-picoquic, and -- when the
# WebTransport adapter is built (MOQ_BUILD_ADAPTER_PICO_WT; the managed helper
# MOQ_BUILD_PICO_WT_MANAGED requires it) -- picoquic::picohttp-core for HTTP/3.
#
# HTTP/WebTransport is an EXPLICIT requirement of this module: when WT is built,
# it guarantees picoquic::picohttp-core or fails here with a precise message. It
# must never report success with only the core target and let the pico_wt
# adapter discover the missing HTTP support later (the WT dependency contract
# lives here, not as a late "target not found" in adapters/pico_wt).
#
# Resolution order:
# 1. Already-defined target (parent add_subdirectory or prior find)
# 2. Installed config package (picoquic-config.cmake in prefix)
# 3. Source-tree mode (local dev):
#      -DMOQ_PICOQUIC_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/picoquic
#      -DMOQ_PICOTLS_PREFIX=/path/to/picotls/build

# WebTransport needs picoquic's HTTP/3 library (picohttp-core). Managed WT
# requires the base WT adapter (enforced in the top-level CMakeLists), so this
# one flag covers both.
set(_MOQ_PQ_NEED_HTTP ${MOQ_BUILD_ADAPTER_PICO_WT})

# No libmoq adapter reads picoquic's PRIVATE headers any more: the drain-capable
# adapters (raw threaded helper and managed WebTransport) derive their
# "stream backlog empty" predicate from the ADAPTER-OWNED send queue
# (moq_pq_send_queue_is_empty) rather than from picoquic_internal.h's
# picoquic_stream_head_t. There is therefore no struct-layout coupling that
# would force the linked library to match a source revision, and an installed
# picoquic CONFIG package is a valid resolution in every mode.
